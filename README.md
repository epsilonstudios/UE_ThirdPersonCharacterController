# UE_ThirdPersonCharacterController

A polished third-person character controller developed in Unreal Engine 5.7, featuring responsive player input built with unreal's new input system with full freedom to setup the input keys within a single click, dynamic camera control, and full 8-directional movement. The project includes sprinting and jumping, supported by many smooth animations blended seamlessly using advanced blend spaces and animation state machines to ensure fluid transitions. The Blueprint system is clean and well-structured, with clearly defined functions, meaningful comments, and an organized interface that improves readability, maintainability, and scalability. This project serves as a strong technical foundation for action-adventure, exploration, or combat-focused games.
